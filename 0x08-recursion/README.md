## ¿Why use it?.

<section id="Recursion">

Recursion is a method in which the solution to a problem depends on the solutions of instances of instances of instances of the same problem. It is the process of repeating elements in a self-similar fashion. If a program allows calling itself within the same function, then it is called a recursive function call. Therefore, a recursive function is one that calls itself. 

When recursion is used, an exit condition must be defined for the function, otherwise it will enter an infinite loop.

It is a different way of iterating, you can use loops like for,while,do while, but with recursion the code is simpler and cleaner, although it is not always the best option, since it uses more resources than loops, for this reason, it is necessary to be careful when to use it.
